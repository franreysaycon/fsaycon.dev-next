# FSAYCON.DEV - Personal Website of Franrey Saycon
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9b7b8139-9333-4e78-b70b-26259036077f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kind-darwin-8469ed/deploys)

Break past your limits! Plus ultra! :fist:

This repo contains the source code for my personal website using Next as the primary framework. I opted for my site to be a SSG rather than server side rendered. JAMStack ftw! :rocket:

## Pre-requisites
- Anything that next needs. https://nextjs.org/
- Yarn installed.

## Installation
```
yarn
```

## Running the Environment
```
yarn dev
```

## Building production
```
yarn deploy
```

This will generate the `out` folder which contains the static generated site derived from the source code.
